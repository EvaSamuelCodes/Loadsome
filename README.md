# Loadsome
My github still needs work, so I've been making fun technical things on weekends.

Loadsome is a bullwork for loading little interconnected mvc apps. 
Should be pretty light and easy to use if you're accustomed to that sort of delinquent behavior.

These repositories reflect my thought process at every step in the design.
Commits are small, and you can review them if you like.

## Current state?

It works. It's loading controllers and views, routes are transparent and functional.

### Todo

1. All the stuff to make models and orm work is already in there, I just haven't written it yet.
2. Going to demonstrate models and sessions with reasonably fleshed out authentication module.
3. Maybe if there's time at some point, a command line tool for building blank modules.
